The increasing integration of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices in critical infrastructure has heightened the vulnerability of industrial systems to cyberattacks. This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the [CIC APT IIoT Dataset 2024](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/iiot-dataset-2024.html), a benchmark dataset that simulates a range of cybersecurity threats in IIoT environments. 

Our research focuses on enhancing the security of IIoT systems through a multi-faceted approach, incorporating advanced machine learning and statistical methods to address key challenges in network traffic analysis and device authentication. By leveraging provenance logs and network traffic data, we propose methodologies to detect anomalies indicative of cyberattacks, safeguard communication protocols, and improve device authentication mechanisms.

The results of our analysis demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches in identifying potential vulnerabilities and mitigating risks within IIoT networks, ultimately contributing to the resilience of industrial systems against evolving cybersecurity threats. This work highlights the importance of developing robust security frameworks tailored to the unique challenges of IIoT environments, underscoring the need for advanced detection and authentication techniques to protect against emerging cyber threats.
